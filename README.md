# github-release-fetcher
## Overview

**Github Release Fetcher** is a Python script that retrieves a list of files/assets for a given GitHub repository release and optionally downloads them.

If a specific release is not provided, the script defaults to the latest release.

It supports filtering files using `--include` and `--exclude`, resuming interrupted downloads, and verifies downloaded file sizes by comparing with the release manifest as a simple sanity check.
